# e1, e4 & e6 players resolver
Resolver written in python :)

### This resolver is broken! :(
This is not working, I intend to release a repo in future which will be able to scrape these sites.

### Supports:
- megacloud.tv's [e1-player](https://megacloud.tv/js/player/a/prod/e1-player.min.js)
- rabbitstream.net's [e4-player](https://rabbitstream.net/js/player/prod/e4-player.min.js)
- rapid-cloud.co's [e6-player](https://rapid-cloud.co/js/player/prod/e6-player-v2.min.js)

### Video:
